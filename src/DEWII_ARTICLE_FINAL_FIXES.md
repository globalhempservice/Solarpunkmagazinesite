2. **Line 252**: "✅ Provenance verification" → "✅ Sustainability information fields (source, certifications, carbon footprint)"

3. **Line 290**: "**Problem:** Rendering 1000+ markers on 3D globe caused lag on mobile." → DELETE THIS WHOLE CHALLENGE #3 (it's redundant with the Key Technical Achievements section and makes false claims)

4. **Line 314**: "Over 70% of our early testers used mobile. Designing desktop-first would have been a disaster." → "Mobile-first design is essential for modern web apps. The majority of users access content on mobile devices."

5. **Line 325**: "Points and unlocks need to be achievable but not trivial. We iterated on unlock thresholds based on user feedback." → "Points and unlocks need to be achievable but not trivial. We designed thresholds to feel rewarding without being grindy."

6. **Line 343**: "**December 1, 2025**" → "**December 2, 2025**"

7. **Line 553**: "Reading it earned you 10 NADA points" → "Reading it earned you 10 Power Up points"
